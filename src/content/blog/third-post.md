## What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a method of managing and provisioning computing infrastructure (servers, networks, storage, etc.) using machine-readable definition files, rather than manual hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.

## Benefits of IaC
- Automates the creation and configuration of infrastructure
- Enables easy scaling up or down of systems
- Ensures consistency across environments (dev, staging, production)
- Improves control, traceability, and versioning of infrastructure
- Reduces human error and increases deployment speed

## Popular IaC Tools
- **Terraform:** Open-source tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently.
- **Ansible:** Automation tool for configuration management, application deployment, and task automation.
- **AWS CloudFormation:** Service for modeling and setting up Amazon Web Services resources.
- **Pulumi:** Modern infrastructure as code platform supporting multiple languages.
- **Chef/Puppet:** Tools for automating infrastructure configuration and management.

## Real-World Applications
- Enterprises use IaC to manage cloud resources at scale.
- Startups automate infrastructure to save time and reduce costs.
- DevOps teams use IaC to ensure repeatable, reliable deployments.

## Best Practices
- Store infrastructure code in version control (e.g., Git)
- Use modular and reusable code
- Test infrastructure changes in isolated environments
- Document infrastructure as code for team collaboration

## Conclusion
IaC is a foundational practice in DevOps, enabling teams to manage infrastructure efficiently, securely, and at scale.
